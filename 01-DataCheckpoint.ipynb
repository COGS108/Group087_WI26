    "What is the relationship between household income and estimated residential carbon emission rates at the census tract level in San Diego County in 2022? With tract-level data, we measure income using Area Median Income (AMI) indicators as well as average annual household income. We can estimate residential carbon emissions using household electricity, natural gas, and other fuel expenditures. We consider this as a statistical inference problem to estimate the degree of association between income levels and emissions in order to understand whether or not income disparities are systematically associated with differences in residential carbon impact across San Diego County census tracts.

    "Over the last fifty years, a growing number of eyes have been focused on the controversial topic of climate change, and by extension carbon emissions. Over this past half-decade, said emissions have skyrocketed dramatically<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1), prompting analysts to explore all aspects surrounding it -- ranging from its consequences, potential solutions, and---most relevant to this project---its roots. Due to this there exists many scientific journals and articles examining potential relationships between certain variables and carbon emissions, with one such variable being income level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussions from scholars suggest an overall consensus that higher income levels, from local to national scales, correlate with higher levels of carbon emissions. Internationally, researcher scholars Sarah Schöngart et al. have used models of wealth groups and emissions data to discover the extent to which affluent groups become responsible for emissions, with \"the wealthiest 10% [contributing] 6.5 times more,\" and \"the top 1% and 0.1% contributing 20x and 76x more...\"<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Honing in on the United States specifically, there are expectedly similar conclusions, as macroeconomist Fredrick N. G. Andersson states \"income inequality is correlated with carbon emissions,\" admittedly with a weaker correlation level.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) Regardless, these two articles are only a small portion of the many findings agreeing with higher-income groups having responsibility for the bulk of carbon emissions. As this idea is seen across nearly every nation, it would be reasonable to believe that smaller region levels such as San Diego would have similar results – though it would be interesting to see if there is such a disproportionate gap as with other regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior analysis utilizing appropriate datasets appear to reinforce the same idea. French economist Lucas Chancel conducted an analysis between income inequality and environmental impact datasets, revealing that the top 10% of earners in the United States and China emit greater tons of CO2 than the other 90% of earners in their respective countries, further highlighting this severe inequality emissions gap.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) Data analysis performed by ourworldindata.org into a chart also shows that high-income and upper-middle-income nations produce more than 30 billion tons of carbon dioxide combined – essentially 10x more than lower-income nations.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5)\n",
    "\n",
    "Many researchers have called to attention other factors surrounding income levels affecting carbon emissions; Amy Richmond and Robert Kauffman determined that energy prices provide a more direct measure of increases in emissions than strictly income per capita. They found that “real oil prices have a statistically measurable effect on per-capita energy use and carbon emissions,” as “higher energy prices reduce energy use… because both firms and households can substitute capital or labor.\"<a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6) Ultimately, this concept supports the idea that an increase in income is associated with an increase in carbon emissions, as individuals with higher incomes can afford more energy, leading to producing more emissions than those with lower incomes. Richmond and Kauffman’s findings prove a need to account for energy prices in our analysis; by only measuring carbon emissions for the year 2022 in San Diego County, we limit the amount of fluctuations in energy prices within our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that much of the research and data surrounding carbon emissions focuses on limiting its overall production, determining the most efficient way the total amount of emissions can be reduced to limit the growth of climate change. For instance, Chancel suggests that “governments [should] develop better data on individual emissions to monitor progress towards sustainable lifestyles,” while Richmond and Kauffman propose that “raising real energy prices may be a more effective means for reducing energy use.” While our project is limited to investigating the relationship between income levels and carbon emissions, our data will fit into the larger scope of evaluating how outside factors affect energy consumption, and in turn, contribute to climate change.\n",

    "We hypothesize that census tracts with higher household income will relate to higher estimated residential carbon emissions per household. We base this expectation on the idea that higher-income households tend to consume more resources in larger homes, producing greater emissions. Therefore, we expect a positive association between income and estimated emissions, which can be further tested controlling for demographics and housing types."

    "  1. Ideal dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal dataset would have tract-level data for San Diego County for a given year, which would be a significant number of observations and enough for modeling/inference. This data would be collected by agencies or groups with access to official or government data collection or reports.  Each observation would include variables on household income, residential energy and fuel consumption, and potentially demographic information. The dataset would be clean and tidy in tabular format, organized with standardized procedures and non-missing data and cleanly labelled columns. Each observation would correspond to a census tract for granularity and accurate analysis.\n",

    "  2. Real dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is located and freely available at https://data.openei.org/submissions/6219. It provides census tract level data for all of California with detailed measurements of income and energy consumption. The important variables in the dataset that we are likely to use are AMI measures, average household income, energy expenditures, and potentially some of the demographic variables to use as controls. **While carbon emissions are not explicitly mentioned as a variable, other variables such as ELEP\\*UNITS (which add up total electricity expenditures), GASP\\*UNITS (which add up total natural gas expenditures), and FULP\\*UNITS (which add up related misc. Fuel expenditures) act as representatives of carbon emissions which will then be used to make inferences.**\n",

    "### Dataset: California Census Tracts and Income Information\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the Low-Income Energy Affordability (LEAD) Tool’s nationwide measurement of housing and energy characteristics for lower-middle income regions in 2022, this dataset specifically focuses on the areas within California’s census tracts, which fits within the scope of our research question. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of the 28 variables which are included in this dataset, there are really only 5 that are of importance. FIP is a unitless 10-digit number representing the county’s FIPS code; for instance, an entry of 6073000100 would be located around the Mission Hills area. The AMI150 variable represents the household’s income in relation to the median income value in their surrounding area, in terms of a number percentage. For example, an entry of 80-100% suggests that the household has an income value that is approximately 80-100% of the area median income. The final three variables are closely connected, as they help approximate the amount of carbon emissions in that census tract: ELEP\\*UNITS, GASP\\*UNITS, and FULP\\*UNITS (all three of which are measured in $/year, as that variable would be multiplied by the amount of households there are, which would ultimately still just be the same variable, just taking into account all the houses.) Respectively, they represent the total annual electricity, gas, and miscellaneous fuel expenditures per year which would be considered when measuring carbon emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the actual research question, there’s a considerable downside in terms of “carbon emissions” not being an actual measured variable; instead having to calculate three other variables to make an inference on it. This runs the risk of potential confounds interfering on whether our study of income level actually relates to carbon emissions or not. Furthermore, as mentioned in the background section of our project proposal, energy prices can affect overall energy consumption levels, which we cannot fully control within our analysis. While we account for this by only analyzing energy consumption in a single calendar year (2022), the data in our model is bound to have been impacted by energy price fluctuations throughout the year. Household size can also impact energy consumption; for instance, a high-income household with no dependents may end up consuming less energy than a low-income household with both children and elders residing in the house. While we cannot control for household size, the TEN-BLD variable (number of units in the building / type of dwelling) lets us control for the distinction between single family and multifamily homes. Despite using a proxy, we can control it with those variables and potentially also the demographic variables included in the dataset. \n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: This is not relevant as the project does not involve direct interaction with people. All data is publicly available and aggregated at census tract level.\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: The data in this dataset could have some systematic bias from the original Department of Energy data collection process, such as sampling bias. However, this data was collected under the Better Building's Clean Energy for Low Income Communities Accelerator (CELICA) for state and local entities to better understand housing and energy characteristics for the low/moderate income communities they serve, so it is intentionally unlikely to have these issues and is largely comprehensive with millions of observations.\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: This is not relevant as the dataset is publicly available government data, inherently anonymized by the granularity and available information.\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: The dataset includes multiple variables centered around demographics, including race and education level. This allows us to potentially include some of these variables in order to control for bias in downstream analysis, serving a better understanding of the data and interpretation of the results of our research task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: This is not relevant as it is publicly accessible government data that is anonymized by the granularity.\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: This is not relevant as it is publicly accessible government data that is anonymized by the granularity.\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: This is not relevant as it is publicly accessible government data that is anonymized by the granularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: This project does not necessarily involve direct engagement with stakeholders, though we do acknowledge taht the data can contain assumptions that do not fully grasp lived experience across census tracts. To address this, we plan to understand literature on energy and environmental justice.\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Potential sources include modeling/inference assumptions to estimate household energy expenditures. We plan to offset this by understanding the literature and discourse on energy and environmental justice, as well as potentially using control variables to do with demographics.\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Our visualizations and summary stats will be designed and communicated to accurately reflect the underlying data without exaggeration of the data. We will clearly label visualizations for clear understanding. Where uncertainty or variability is high, we can address this through distributional plots or confidence intervals rather than single summary values.\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: There is no PII used or displayed at any stage of the analysis. We examine the data that is provided at the census tract level, without any individual reconstruction. This ensures that privacy is preserved throughout the analytical process.\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Our analysis will be documented through our GitHub repo with code and written descriptions of EDA and modeling/inference decisions. This documentation ensures that the analysis can be reproduced and audited if any errors or concerns arise. Clear separation between raw data, cleaned data, and derived variables for analysis will further support transparency and reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Although this project does not involve decision making about individuals, there is a risk that income or demographic variables could act as proxies for protected characteristics. To address this, we avoid using demographic variables as primary predictors and instead include them as controls to contextualize results. The goal is to understand structural associations rather than to rank or evaluate specific groups.\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Model results will be examined across different demographic and income strata to identify whether associations differ substantially between groups. We can check whether residual patterns or estimated effects systematically vary across protected groups to help ensure that conclusions do not disproportionately misrepresent or obscure impacts on particular populations.\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: We primarily focus on interpretability of regression coefficients rather than optimizing a single performance metric. Model fit statistics may be considered in order to avoid overemphasizing overall fit at the expense of understanding differential impacts.\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: The modeling approach is intentionally limited to interpretable methods, such as linear or generalized linear regression. This ensures that relationships between income, energy expenditures, and estimated emissions can be clearly explained in non-technical terms. \n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Limitations of the model, including reliance on expenditure-based emissions estimates, aggregation at the census tract level, and potential omitted variables, will be clearly communicated in the final report. These limitations will be presented in acessible language to avoid overstating the precision or generalizability of our findings.\n",

    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: This is not relevant as this is a short-term, exploratory analysis project and does not involve deploying a model or system for ongoing use. As a result, post-deployment monitoring, performance tracking, or concept drift evaluation are not applicable.\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: This is not relevant as this is a short-term, exploratory analysis project and does not involve deploying a model or system for ongoing use. As such, there are no end users that can be harmed by the results or operational impacts. We nevertheless aim to present results responsibly to minimize redress through misinterpretation.\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: This is not relevant as this is a short-term, exploratory analysis project and does not involve deploying a model or system for ongoing use. As such, there’s no deployment that can be rolled back. If errors are discovered, the analysis and conclusions can be revised within the project submission.\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: This is not relevant as this is a short-term, exploratory analysis project and does not involve deploying a model or system for ongoing use. While we acknowledge that findings could be misinterpreted out of context, preventing misuse beyond the scope of this class project is not applicable as it’s not deployed."

    "* Communication should be done via Discord, mostly through the already established group chat, but private matters can be discussed through direct messages as well.\n",
    "* In most cases, everyone is expected to read and respond to the group message within 24 hours since the chat is sent. However, this rule is relaxed during the weekend so group members are expected to already read and respond to the group messages by the coming Monday. The tolerated hours might be reduced when deadlines are close and it’s mentioned before during a group meeting that replies are expected to be as soon as possible.\n",
    "* Meetings are done weekly on Mondays at 9 AM, Peterson Hall. This is done hybrid, where the main meeting is in person but those who can’t meet during this time can join the Discord call either.\n",
    "* The tone of the group’s communication should be blunt, but friendly. Each group member is expected to voice any concerns or thoughts on every decision the group makes. However, friendliness and politeness in tone is expected. Generally, criticisms and suggestions should be delivered with reasons and without starting a fight.\n",
    "* Decision making is done via majority voting, especially for the project-wide and big decisions. However, if the decision is about specific and delegated tasks, like how to implement an algorithm used for the project, the delegated team member is allowed to do as they please as long as it doesn’t go against the agreed big picture.\n",
    "* Decision making for a short time frame should include calling the group chat to make sure as many members as possible are able to voice their opinions. However, for decisions due in a very short time frame like within an hour, a majority of whoever is available after calling the group chat is followed.\n",
    "* Specializations and tasks will be assigned as we move through each part of the project based on who is available to work the most during the week.\n",
    "* To-do lists and the agreed upon due dates are available in the group’s Google Docs.\n",
    "* Each member is expected to submit their work through pushing their part to Github. This doesn’t apply to the project proposal.\n",
    "* Everyone is expected to help other members that are struggling if they understand how. Members that are struggling with their delegated task must quickly state it in the Discord group chat way before the agreed due date of the task.\n",
    "* Planned items’ due dates are set as we move through each part of the project. Generally, they must be completed about 12 hours before the deliverable due date of the assignment, if they are already agreed in meetings / group chat to be submitted in the upcoming checkpoint."
